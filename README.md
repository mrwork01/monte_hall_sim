## Monte Hall Simulation

__**Purpose:**__

In 'Let's Make a Deal', a classic game show from the 60's and 70's, host Monte Hall would present 3 doors to a contestant.  Behind one of the doors was a car the contestant could win.  Behind the other 2 doors was a goat, meaning the contestant went home empty handed.  Monte would ask the contestant to pick a door.  Once a door was selected, one of the unselected doors was opened, revealing a goat.  The contestant would then have the option to change thier pick or keep thier original door.  The Monte Hall Problem is a statistical thought experiment to determine if it is more beneficial to keep your initial door or change doors.  When I would explain the statistics behind your choice, many people did not believe me.  Due to this, I created this simulator to show them how statistical analysis can imporove thier fortunes.
